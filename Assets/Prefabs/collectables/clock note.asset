    since I''ve got here. I think I''m going insane in this house. I wanted to leave
    this morning but my boots were gone. I asked Anne but she said the dog might
    have eaten them. I have not seen any sign of a dog since I got here. What is
    going on? They went out yesterday and came home late. Ever since then a smell
    has been coming from the basement. '
