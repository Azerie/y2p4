  journalEntry: 'I barely made it through the cold, why does our weather have to
    be so bad? After such a good time at the Goorse market I thought my luck had
    turned around. Nevertheless, I was found by the Annink family, they gave me a
    bed for the night in their home. They sure have a lovely house, I thought they
    were poor but I must have been mistaken, Oh well. I need to stay here for a few
    days to get my strength back '
