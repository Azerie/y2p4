  journalEntry: 'Something weird just happened.  I was just trying to sleep when
    there was some light creeping into my room. I think Klaas lit some candles or
    something. I heard him talking to his son. I''m not sure what it was about, but
    I heard some weird noises after, almost as if something opened. I think I''m 
    just going a bit crazy it has been a stressful few days. I just need to rest
    some more. '

    up do something?
