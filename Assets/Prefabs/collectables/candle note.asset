    Something weird just happened.  I was just trying to sleep when there was some
    light creeping into my room. I think Klaas lit some candles or something. I heard
    him talking to his son. I''m not sure what it was about, but I heard some weird
    noises after, almost as if something opened. I think I''m  just going a bit crazy
    it has been a stressful few days. I just need to rest some more. '
