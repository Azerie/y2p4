  journalEntry: 'Entry 218 September 25th ???   I managed to unlock the basement
    door. The smell only grew more intense the further down I went. Only when I lit
    my candle I could see what caused the stench. Corpses or better yet what was
    left of them. Most of them were mutilated beyond recognition. Only one of them
    had his eyes left, It was looking straight at me. Not long after I heard the
    door open, Klaas was coming. Luckily I was able to hide on time. I need to tell
    someone! I need to leave! '
