  journalEntry: 'Alright there is definitely something going on here. I saw Klaas
    walk into this room with all these books, and followed him to ask about something.
    And when I looked in the room he wasn''t there. Thats not the only thing, I saw
    a door knob sticking out of one of the paintings. I suspect he has some sort
    of room behind there, but why would he have it and for what? I need to get out
    of here as fast as possible! '
