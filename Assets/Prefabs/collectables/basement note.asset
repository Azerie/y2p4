  journalEntry: 'Entry 217 September 25th ???   The smell coming from the basement
    is killing me. It smells like something or someone died in there. I was trying
    to open the door and get in but got stopped when the son came walking by. It
    was a close one, but luckily he believed I was lost looking for a bathroom. I
    can''t take the risk anymore. First thing tomorrow I''m getting out of here. '
