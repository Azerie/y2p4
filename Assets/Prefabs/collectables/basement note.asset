  journalEntry: 'The smell coming from the basement is killing me. It smells like
    something or someone died in there. I was trying to open the door and get in
    but got stopped when the son came walking by. It was a close one, but luckily
    he believed I was lost looking for a bathroom. I can''t take the risk anymore.
    First thing tomorrow I''m getting out of here. '
